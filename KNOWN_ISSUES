MAJOR:
* UI: the "autologon" property is currently useless, we may add a "connect" button inside the menu
* UI: the "connect at startup" property is currently useless, we may connect sessions when a new user logs in
* Currently we do not allow more than 1 jar per driver, and the user cannot change it

MINOR:
* local Maven repository: why transitive dependencies are not loaded?
* JAX-RS: can we fully disable MOXy ? and avoid one MessageWriter per each class?
* JAX-RS: Why some exception are not rendered correctly? e.g. ValidationException's
* Material Dashboard: why I cannot use icons with "_" in menu, such as account_tree ?
* UI: the list of drivers inside the menu is too long, it's not very handy
